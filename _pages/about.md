Ph.D. in Computer Science, I study the energy and environmental impact of deep learning models applied to audio signals. I started my research at IRCAM (Institut de Recherche en Coordination Acoustique/Musique) through neural audio synthesis and developed a methodology to assess the trade-offs between audio quality and energy efficiency of deep learning models. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA Nancy, where I continue my research in the field of sound event detection, with the goal of extending my work on environmental impact to deep learning systems in general.
